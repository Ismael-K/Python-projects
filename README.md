Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook that uses Python to easily retrieve and handle data.  Open-source Python packages such as Pandas and Matplotlib can be used for scientific programming and to create visuals for the data set.  For example, Matplotlib can be used to obtain a scatter plot for the Number of Items Ordered per Order Price from the Chiplotle data set.
